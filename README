These are the steps to set up, start and use the Python Local Micro Scheduler (PLMS):

(1)SETTING UP FOLDERS 
Run 'python setup.py here' which sets up the necessary folders and symlinks needed. Right 
now the only setup option is here which is in the current project directory.

(2)INCLUDING PATH
In your .bash_profile you can add the bin folder path to your PATH. This enables you to 
run the scheduler simply by the command 'plms'.

(3)STARTING SCHEDULER
To start a scheduler with a default configuration one simply runs:
'start-pmls -d -n'
which simply means that you want the scheduler to be a daemon and you use the default configuration.
The default configuration means that the scheduler will listen to connection on port 5555, the scheduler name
will be the same as the hostname and the maximum number of simultaneous jobs is set to 2.
If you want to change the configuration you can edit the configuration file in the .conf/scheduler folder in the 
project folder.
